# Byte Net - A Comprehensive EdTech Platform

## Introduction

**Byte Net** is a cutting-edge platform designed to revolutionize the learning experience for students by providing free access to world-class programming courses alongside unique AI-driven assistance and mental health support. Byte Net integrates multiple modern technologies such as **Blockchain**, **AI**, and **Augmented Reality** to create an interactive, stress-relieving, and enriching learning environment.

### Features

1. **Courses on Programming Languages and Technologies**
   - Byte Net offers courses on popular and advanced technologies such as:
     - Blockchain
     - Artificial Intelligence (AI)
     - Augmented Reality (AR)
     - Other emerging technologies
   - All courses are curated from trusted YouTube channels like **FreeCodeCamp** and **Harvard**, ensuring access to high-quality learning material.

2. **Playground Section with Coding AI Assistant**
   - In the Playground section, students can interact with our AI-powered coding assistant. This AI is designed to provide real-time coding support, debugging assistance, and personalized suggestions to improve coding skills.

3. **Mental Well-being AI**
   - The platform integrates a mental well-being section with an AI specifically built to help students manage stress. The AI responds to mental health queries and offers tips to maintain a balanced mindset, thus improving productivity and learning outcomes.

4. **VIP Section with Matic Blockchain**
   - Byte Net features a VIP section that offers exclusive content and premium learning resources. Users can access this section by making payments via the **Matic blockchain**.
   - **Note**: Due to limitations in VPS server hosting and lack of funds, the Matic payment gateway node server isn't integrated into the live platform. However, we have provided the code for the payment gateway that can be set up by users with the necessary server resources. See [Matic Payment Gateway Code](https://github.com/09Catho/Maticpayment/tree/main).

5. **Augmented Reality (AR) Section**
   - The AR section of the platform offers an immersive experience where students can interact with learning content in an augmented environment, making the learning of complex concepts more engaging and intuitive.
